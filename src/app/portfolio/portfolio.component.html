      <h2>Savetest - agile way to test your app</h2>
      <p>There seems to be a never ending cycle between QA engineers and coders. The coder happily pushes 2 commits and 2 hours later QA comes back with 7 bugs. Testing environments seeem to be too intricate for developers to be focusing their energy in keeping track of all the testing tools, therefore, there is a need to assign QA developers to work specifically in the task of finding bugs before code reaches production.<br><br>For this reason, developers rarely need to set a test environment when working on new features. Nevertheless, it is useful and important to be able to test your application often. There is even a concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), though it seems to have been forgotten as fixed-timeline projects become more obtrusive. If given the choice, clients rarely see a benefit in starting a project as a TDD, and minimizing the costs upfront is what gets companies the most clients.<br><br>The industry seems to be taking the shortest route and there seems to be more cases of delagating the Quality Assurance to a later and minimal phase.<br><br>I started <b>Savetest</b> in order to provide developers with an easy to use automation tool to <b>rapidly add test cases during development without interrupting an agile life cycle.</b> Moreover, the tests are stored as JSON objects making them easy to export them for reuse. <i>Here is a quick demo usage:</i>
